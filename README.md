## 📚 Library Book Borrowing System
A simple console-based Java application that simulates a library system where users can borrow books if available. The system uses a HashMap to store book availability and displays the borrowing time using LocalDateTime.

## ✅ Features
📖 Predefined book collection stored using HashMap

🔎 Checks if a book is available

🕒 Displays date and time of borrowing

❌ Prevents borrowing already borrowed books

🚫 Informs user if book is not found in the system

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
Java (Core)

HashMap for book storage

Scanner for input

LocalDateTime and DateTimeFormatter for timestamp

## 📄 How It Works
User enters the name of the book they want to borrow.

If the book is available:

It is marked as borrowed.

The current timestamp is printed.

If already borrowed, the system shows an appropriate message.

If the book does not exist, the system informs the user.
